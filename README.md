# Week-1
By using machine learning and artificial intelligence we can predict the water quality by analysing various parameters like Ph,turbidity and dissolved oxygen 
OVERVIEW:
In this project we can select different datasets and we can predict the quality of water by using machine learning .
TECHNOLOGIES USED:
Here we can use various technologies such that machine learning and artificial intelligence 
various Machine learning algorithms are used such that KNN(K-Nearest Neighbour) and random forest and it gives good and accurate results .
